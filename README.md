## Research Paper
### [Enhancing search engine precision and user experience through sentiment-based polysemy resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01895)

### Abstract 
With the proliferation of digital content and the need for efficient information retrieval, this study's insights can be applied to various domains, including news services, e-commerce, and digital marketing, to provide users with more meaningful and tailored experiences. The study addresses the common problem of polysemy in search engines, where the same keyword may have multiple meanings. It proposes a solution to this issue by embedding a smart search function into the search engine, which can differentiate between different meanings based on sentiment. The study leverages sentiment analysis, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) technique, to classify and categorize news articles based on their emotional tone. This can provide more insightful and nuanced search results. The article reports an impressive accuracy rate of 85% for the proposed smart search function, which outperforms conventional search engines. This indicates the effectiveness of the sentiment-based approach. The research explores multiple sentiment analysis models, including Sentistrength and Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), to determine the best-performing approach. The findings can be applied to enhance search engines, making them more capable of understanding the context and intent behind users 'queries. This can lead to better search results that are more aligned with what users are looking for. The proposed smart search function can improve the user experience by reducing the need to sift through irrelevant search results. This is particularly important in an age where information overload is common.
